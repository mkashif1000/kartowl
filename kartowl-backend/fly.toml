# Optional: Create a swap file on startup to help with Playwright memory spikes
# This requires a custom start script or entrypoint, but we can try using a release command

# Fly.io automatically adds some swap for 512mb machines usually, but explicit request is safer?
# Actually default shared-cpu-1x:256mb doesn't, but 512mb might.
